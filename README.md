# PrimeNumberLibrary

This makefile will compile and create an executable file called fermatprime. This would require an argument which can hold a long long int 
value.

To execute the command type:

./fermatprime <number>

where <number> is the number that you want to check.

Keep in mind that this program is based on Fermat's Primality Test and is not very accurate. I am still working on ways that can improve the 
accuracy of this function.

The prime.h library also has some (extra) functions that you might like to try and are very usefull. I haven't used most of them because they 
were increasing the speed at which it checks the nunmber but they can still be modified to get better results.
